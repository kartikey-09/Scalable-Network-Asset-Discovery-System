# AI Prompts and Explanations for Network Asset Discovery System

This document contains the AI prompts used to generate specific code improvements or strategies for the `Scalable Network Asset Discovery System`. Below, you'll find the prompts, the AI’s responses, and an explanation of how and why these approaches were adopted.

### 1. **Prompt: Optimize JPA batch insert configuration for high-performance**

**AI Prompt:**
> "Suggest an optimal JPA batch insert configuration to handle high-throughput inserts in a system where over 1,000 devices are discovered per second, and batch size is configurable."

**AI Response:**
> The recommended configuration involves setting the `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` property and enabling both `hibernate.order_inserts` and `hibernate.order_updates`. This setup reduces the number of round trips between the application and database, boosting performance by executing bulk inserts. Here's the configuration:
>
> ```yaml
> spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size: 100
> spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_inserts: true
> spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_updates: true
> ```
>
> - **Explanation:** 
>   - **Batch Size:** It improves efficiency by grouping multiple insert statements into a single SQL batch.
>   - **Order Inserts/Updates:** It ensures that inserts and updates are grouped and executed in the optimal order to minimize overhead.

### 2. **Prompt: Create an exponential backoff strategy for failed device scans**

**AI Prompt:**
> "How can I implement an exponential backoff strategy for retrying failed device scans in the DiscoveryService?"

**AI Response:**
> An exponential backoff strategy should be implemented with a growing delay for each retry attempt. Below is a pseudocode strategy:
> 
> ```java
> int retryAttempts = 0;
> int maxRetries = 5;
> int baseDelay = 1000; // 1 second
> while (retryAttempts < maxRetries) {
>     try {
>         // Attempt the discovery process
>         discoverDevices();
>         break; // Exit loop on success
>     } catch (Exception e) {
>         // Apply exponential backoff
>         int delay = (int) Math.pow(2, retryAttempts) * baseDelay;
>         Thread.sleep(delay); // Retry after exponential delay
>         retryAttempts++;
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> - **Explanation:** 
>   - **Exponential Backoff:** The retry delay grows exponentially (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 seconds), which prevents overwhelming the system after multiple failures, giving it time to recover.
>   - **Maximum Retries:** A maximum retry limit avoids indefinite retrying and ensures the system eventually stops trying.

### 3. **Prompt: Generate Spring Kafka configuration for the producer**

**AI Prompt:**
> "What is the optimal configuration for Spring Kafka producer to send events to Kafka efficiently, with a focus on ensuring that events are sent in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner?"

**AI Response:**
> Below is the Spring Kafka producer configuration:
> 
> ```java
> @Configuration
> @EnableKafka
> public class KafkaProducerConfig {
> 
>     @Bean
>     public ProducerFactory<String, AssetDiscoveredEvent> producerFactory() {
>         Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();
>         config.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
>         config.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
>         config.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, JsonSerializer.class);
>         return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(config);
>     }
> 
>     @Bean
>     public KafkaTemplate<String, AssetDiscoveredEvent> kafkaTemplate() {
>         return new KafkaTemplate<>(producerFactory());
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> - **Explanation:**
>   - **Producer Configuration:** The `bootstrap-servers` point to the Kafka cluster, while `StringSerializer` and `JsonSerializer` ensure the event is serialized appropriately.
>   - **KafkaTemplate:** This acts as the interface for sending events to Kafka. It ensures efficient, asynchronous event publishing.

### 4. **Prompt: Prevent thread starvation during subnet scans**

**AI Prompt:**
> "How can thread starvation be prevented when scanning a large range of IPs (e.g., 172.16.0.0/16 to 172.31.255.255) while using a fixed pool of 20 threads?"

**AI Response:**
> The solution is to ensure that tasks are distributed efficiently and the threads don’t wait unnecessarily for one another. This can be achieved by:
> 
> - **Balanced Task Allocation:** Ensure the tasks are split into smaller, independent batches to avoid blocking threads.
> - **ExecutorService with fair scheduling:** Use `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()` with `ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy` to handle rejected tasks by executing them in the caller's thread.
> 
> Example code:
> ```java
> ExecutorService executorService = new ThreadPoolExecutor(20, 20, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(1000), new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
> ```
>
> - **Explanation:**
>   - **ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy:** This ensures that when the pool is saturated, the caller’s thread will run the task, ensuring no thread starvation.
>   - **Balanced Task Allocation:** By splitting the IP range into smaller tasks, we ensure no thread is overloaded with too many tasks, preventing delays.
